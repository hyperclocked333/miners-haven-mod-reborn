# Miners Haven Mod: Reborn (FIXED)

~~make sure to execute before you load in your slot or the script wont have shit it needs to like work, and it will kick you~~
changelog 8/31/23 
**THANKS TO A NEW SYSTEM USED TO GRAB THE FUNCTIONS.. 
YOU CAN NOW EXECUTE AT ANY TIME AND HAVE THE SCRIPT FUNCTION!** 

high security updates, as the start said
anticheat repatch (god hes consistent)
anti-mouse tracker (you arent slick dint)

drawbacks:
  for auto-rebirth, make sure your setup has NO SHOP ITEMS AT ALL. having shop items will prompt you for purchase (regardless of the setting) and stall the script from doing anything, as it detects as true when the function returns a value (aka when the layout fully loads

plannned additions:  
leaderboard stats
